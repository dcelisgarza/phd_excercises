		Debye sheaths are an important aspect of plasma-wall interactions in Tokamak fusion reactors. In this paper we study a simple model of Debye sheaths which accounts for ion recombination. Recombinations cause a decrease in the ion density as we get nearer the wall, affecting all other sheath quantities. We found an approximate relationship between the collision lengthscale's ($L$) and recombination rate's ($R$) magnitudes. We also prove that at very big and very small values of $L$, the modified model asymptotically approaches the case where ion continuity is assumed. We also found that at small collision lengths, the sheath's quantities' profiles are dominated by collisions rather than recombinations; while at larger collision lengths, the opposite is true. As a result of the last fact, we only show the results of a ``sweet-spot'' in $L$ values that exposes relatively large differences in behaviour between keeping the ion density constant and accounting for recombinations.

	\section{Introduction}
	%
	Plasma wall interactions are an important aspect of tokamak plasmas. The knowledge gained by studying them can lead to better reactor geometries, diagnostic equipment and wall materials. The difficulty however, is in experimental testing. It is impractical, slow, expensive and inconvenient to set up a fusion reaction experiment. This makes modelling an attractive prospect in fusion research.
	
	One key aspect of plasma-wall interactions are Debye sheaths, which cause heating, damage and erosion \cite{sheath}. They are formed because the tokamak walls are at an effective electrostatic potential with respect to the plasma itself. As a result, electrons travel to the wall and generate an electric field which attracts ions to the wall \cite{bohm}. Idealised models assume ion-continuity (no loss or gain of ions through ionisation or recombination) and no collisions between ions. 
	
	Many attempts at modelling Debye sheaths have been made in the past \cite{lpcs}, but in this paper we examine a normalised and simple model where we only take recombinations into account. In the completely idealised model---no collisions and no recombination---we have the following system of equations (ignoring $x$-dependence),
	\begin{subequations}
		\begin{align}
			\difx{\phi} &= -E \label{se:is1}\\
			\difx{E} &= n_{i} - \exp(\phi) = - \ddifx{\phi} \label{se:is2}\\
			v_{i} &= \sqrt{v_{s}^{2} - 2 \phi} \qquad \textrm{(conservation of energy)}\label{se:is3}\\
			n_{i} &= \dfrac{v_{s}}{v_{i}} \qquad \textrm{(conservation of mass)}\label{se:is4},
		\end{align}
	\end{subequations}
	where $\phi \equiv$ electrostatic potential, $E \equiv$ electric field, $v_{i} \equiv$ ion velocity and $n_{i} \equiv$ ion number density are all functions of $x$. The $s$ subscript denotes initial values. If we then calculate $\difx{v_{i}}$, and subtract a term that scales inversely w.r.t. collision length $L$ and proportionally to $v_{i}$ we obtain,
	\begin{align}
		\difx{v_{i}} = \dfrac{E}{v_{i}} - \dfrac{v_{i}}{L},\label{se:s3}
	\end{align}
	which can be solved to find $v_{i}$. Ion recombinations can be modelled in the same manner, this time using \cref{se:is4} $\left(\difx{v_{i} n_{i}}\right)$. Equating this to a negative reaction rate (ions are lost) that is proportional to the ion number density, allows us to model recombinations in a reasonably simple fashion. After rearranging for $\difx{n_{i}}$ we find,
	\begin{align}
		\difx{n_{i}} &= \dfrac{n_{i}}{v_{i}} \left(R - \difx{v_{i}}\right).\label{se:s4}
	\end{align}
	In our model, the solutions to \cref{se:s3,se:s4} replace \cref{se:is3,se:is4}.
	
	The normalised current as a function of $x$ is then calculated as,
	\begin{align}
		J = \sqrt{\dfrac{m_{i}}{2\pi m_{e}}} \exp(\phi) - 1 \label{s:curr}
	\end{align}
	where $m_{i} \equiv 1080,~m_{e} \equiv 1$.
	
	It is worth noting that all normalisations were detailed in previous assignments.

	\section{Results}\label{s:results}	
	%
	The model was implemented in an object-oriented fashion on Python, utilising the SciPy and NumPy libraries. SciPy's \texttt{odeint} function uses the Fortran library \texttt{ODEPACK} for its integration subroutines. \mintinline{fortran}{ODEPACK} contains a variety of integration methods for both stiff and non-stiff systems. The workhorse of integration schemes are so-called multi step methods for their flexibility and numerical stability. The most famous of which are Runge-Kutta schemes for non-stiff systems and Adams-Bashworth for stiff ones. Fortunately for the end user, \texttt{ODEPACK}'s generic interfaces allows us to na\"{i}vely call the integration subroutine and let the computer decide which scheme to use. Our system is non-stiff \footnote{Outside of certain regimes where numerical blow-up occurs such as $L=0$, or when \cref{e:rl} is not comfortably met.}, which means that an RK method is used, most likely an embedded variant of RK4 such as the Kash-Carp, Fehlberg or Dormand-Prince methods with adaptive step size. There are various alternatives, most notably an open-source object-oriented Fortran library with a huge variety of solvers \cite{foodie}.
	
	\Cref{f:rslt} shows the effects of including plasma recombination in our model of the Debye sheath. The parameters used were chosen so as to showcase the largest differences between scenarios at constant collision length, our reasoning is described further detail in \cref{s:discussion}.
	
	It was found that in order for the Debye sheath to remain stable, the magnitude of the normalised recombination constant should approximately satisfy the inequality,
	\begin{align}
		L_{\times 10^{b}} > |R|_{\times 10^{-|b+0.15|}},\label{e:rl}
	\end{align}
	where the subscript indicates the values are given in terms of $a \times 10^{b}$. Else the rate at which ions are lost through recombination is so great that the solutions for \cref{se:s4} are non-smooth, indicating the sheath becomes unstable and breaks down.
	
	From \cref{sf:rslta} that at short collision lengths and comparable recombination rates, the overall dynamics of the system don't change. Aside from the ion continuity equation, the system looks very similar for both values of $R$---indicating the dominant behaviour is the collision length as opposed to the recombination rate. We find however, that the Debye sheath grows in size when we model recombinations. Critical points such as the minima and maxima in ion velocity and density are shifted further away from the wall, but their actual values don't change much compared to their idealised counterparts.
	
	Conversely, in \cref{sf:rsltb}, we see a much greater difference between systems. Not only does the sheath grow to almost three times the size of the unmodified case, but the profile of every quantity changes significantly. In this regime, the recombination rate becomes much more important. 
	
	Comparing both \cref{sf:rslta,sf:rsltb} we see that ion continuity in the latter decreases almost exponentially, as opposed to the corresponding case in \cref{sf:rslta} which is Gaussian-like. This seemingly minor difference hides the fact that the dynamics of collision-dominant and recombination-dominant systems are vastly different. Comparing the other quantities we note that the latter's are much more spread out across the sheath length. They also present a greater number of inflexion points, which lends evidence towards slightly more oscillatory dynamics.
	
	\section{Discussion}\label{s:discussion}
	In order to explain our choice of parameters we turn to \cref{se:s3}. Firstly we note that,
	\begin{subequations}
		\begin{align}
			\lim\limits_{L \to \infty} \difx{v_{i}} &= \dfrac{E}{v_{i}}\\
			\lim\limits_{L \to \infty} \int\limits_{v_{s}}^{v_{i}} v_{i} \mathrm{d}v_{i} &= \int E \mathrm{d}x\\
			\lim\limits_{L \to \infty} v_{i} &= \sqrt{v_{s}^{2} - 2\phi}.\label{se:vi}
		\end{align}
	\end{subequations}
	Meaning that \cref{se:s3} asymptotically approaches the value of the unmodified model. Furthermore, if $L \to 0 \Rightarrow \difx{v_{i}} \to \infty$. Therefore we must keep $L$ reasonably small if we want avoid asymptotic behaviour to the unmodified model, and reasonably big if we want to keep our solutions smooth.
	
	Secondly we realise that,
	\begin{subequations}
		\begin{align}
			\lim\limits_{R \to 0} \difx{n_{i}} &= -\dfrac{n_{i}}{v_{i}} \difx{v_{i}} \\
			\lim\limits_{R \to 0} \int\limits_{1}^{n_{i}}\dfrac{\mathrm{d} n_{i}}{n_{i}} &= -\int\limits_{v_{s}}^{v_{i}}\dfrac{\mathrm{d} v_{i}}{v_{i}}\\
			\lim\limits_{R \to 0} n_{i}v_{i} &= v_{s}, \label{s:cont}
		\end{align}
	\end{subequations}
	is the ion continuity equation (a constant value). So we must keep $|R| > 0$ if we want to compare the modified model to the case with no recombination. 
	
	At the same time we know from \cref{se:s4} that if,
	\begin{subequations}
		\begin{align}
			\left|R - \difx{v_{i}}\right| &\ggg 0 \\
			\textrm{ assuming: } R + \dfrac{v_{i}}{L} &\gg \dfrac{E}{v_{i}} \nonumber \\
			\left|R + \dfrac{v_{i}}{L}\right| &\ggg 0
		\end{align}
	\end{subequations}
	the solution to \cref{se:s4} would be non-smooth. This analysis prompted our choice of parameters. The definition of \cref{e:rl} was obtained so that the solutions across $L \in [10^{-7}, 10^{7}]$ remained smooth yet sufficiently different from the case where $R = 0$.
	
	With this information, our observations---and choice to include only two values of $L$---can be fully explained. Looking at \cref{se:s3,se:s4} we realise that the extent to which $R$ affects the system depends on the magnitude of $L$. As $L \to 0$, the effect of $R$ will be minimised because $L^{-1} \to \infty$ and thus dominate in \cref{se:s4}. Conversely, as $L$ grows, $R$ will begin to have more of an effect on \cref{se:s4} until $L$ is so large that \cref{se:s3} starts converging to \cref{se:vi}. At which point, given \cref{e:rl}, \cref{se:s4} will converge to \cref{s:cont}. Thus by choosing $L = \left\{10^{-1}, 10\right\}$, we observe appreciable differences between scenarios, which is not the case for other values.

	\section{Conclusion}
	%
	We successfully modelled Debye sheaths with a simple modification to the ion continuity equation to account for ions lost within the sheath via recombination. We found an approximate relationship between the magnitudes of the collision lengthscale and recombination rate required for sheath stability. We also prove that at very large and very small values of $L$, the modified model asymptotically approaches the case where ion continuity is assumed. As a result, we only showed the results of a ``sweet-spot'' in $L$ values where recombinations have a noticeable effect on the sheath. At small values in the range, the sheath's dynamics are dominated by collisions rather than recombinations; the opposite is true for larger values in the range.
